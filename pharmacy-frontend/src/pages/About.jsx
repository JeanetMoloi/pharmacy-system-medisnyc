                    MediSync started as a CPUT ICT Application Development capstone project: a pharmacy
                    prescription system that keeps patients, doctors and pharmacy staff working from the
                    same information, instead of three separate systems and a lot of phone calls.

                            Booking an appointment, getting a diagnosis, and collecting a prescription usually
                            involves three disconnected steps. MediSync brings them into one flow so nothing
                            gets lost between the doctor's desk and the pharmacy counter.

                            Make it obvious, at every step, what stage a prescription is at — for the patient
                            waiting on it and the pharmacist filling it.

                            the same language, so nobody has to re-enter the same information twice.
